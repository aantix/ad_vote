== Description

Test your Google Adword campaigns cheaply.  Say you're trying to target the expensive keywords 'mortgage refinance'.
You could write some ads, put them up in your adword campaign, and hope for the best.

Or you could utilize Mechanical Turk.  You could download all of your competitors ads for 'mortgage refinance', download
all of the search results for 'mortgage refinance', mix in your ads alongside competitors, and for 5-10 cents,
have Turkers vote on which result/ad they find most appealing.

Five cents a click certainly beats $50 a click.

== Create a Study

You setup a "study" where you define the search term(s) that you wish to test your personal ad
revisions against.   Your personal ad revisions are uploaded via a .csv file.
You can view some sample Ad campaigns in the data/ directory.

Here's the study creation screen :

== Mechanical Turk Task

Once you've created your study, the organic search results and competing ads are downloaded for your search terms.  Then, a series of tasks are created on Mechanical Turk asking the worker which result they would click if they had performed this search.
Your personal ad revisions are mixed in alongside the competing ads and organic search results.

Here's a sample of the interface the worker sees if our study was for the query "grass fed beef" :

== Notes

If an organic search result gets the highest number of clicks (which they generally do), maybe there are keywords or phrases from that page that you could be utilizing in your campaign?
